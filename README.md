Introduction/Business Problem:

The city of Toronto is looking to increase tourism and for locals to purchase goods and services. The idea of an automated concierge service has received positive feedback as a quick way to get an automated itinerary for a day out in the city. The city of Toronto wants to develop a proof of concept to build an automated itinerary using Foursquare data. Using this data, alongside Toronto postal information, the algorithm will create a brief itenrary for 1 day which includes three restaurants and two attractions. Algorithm details to generate itinerary to be determined. Working alongside third parties such as airlines, buses, taxis and more, we can market this program as a means to make downtown venues exciting, and easy to plan for. Utilizing transportation services as means for marketing, and for the service to provide a highly recommended itinerary will generate buzz around visiting Toronto downtown venues.

Data:

Foursquare provides a highly enriched data set regarding venues in a particular radius with useful attributes such as venue categorization, hours, popular times, menu, price, rating, likes, dislikes and more. These attributes, alongside the borough data set will allow for better generation as the itinerary will need to be able to recommend three restaurants and two attractions within a single borough.
